# Button Blink
The objective of this section of the lab was to use the button as a switch to changed the state of the LED. Upon pressing the button the LED would go from off to flasing at a desired rate or from off to on with no toggle. This is done by using an while loop that waits for the button to be pressed. When the pressed the LED is toggled or set on.
